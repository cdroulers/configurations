# ZSH

Configs / setups for zsh

Running `../osx/setup-symlinks.sh` (or linux) will link your `.zprofile`.

## Oh my zsh

It should be auto-linked with above script, but if not, install with this and re-link.

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

## Install Powerlevel10k (theme / prompt manager)

https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#oh-my-zsh

Above install is required since I don't commit the `custom` folder.

## Next steps (probably all done for now)

Finish setup for theme for zsh and tmux
