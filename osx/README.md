# OSX

Stuff for OSX

## setup-symlinks

Creates symlinks from root folder configurations for apps to the right path. e.g. nvim, alacritty, tmux, etc.

## Keymaps

Remaps I've set in OSX to make more sense

ctrl+cmd+left|right => move virtual desktop left or right
ctrl+cmd+up => Mission control (not very useful)

ctrl+shift+space => switch keyboard layout (until I figure out how to make Canadian - PC stick for logins
cmd+D => Show desktop (lel windows)

ctrl+alt+left|right|up|down => Halve windows
ctrl+alt+F => Fill (fullscreen)
ctrl+alt+C => Center
ctrl+alt+Z => Zoom (maximize)
